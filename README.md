# VANTA OS — Autonomous Capital Intelligence Stack

**VANTA OS** is a governed, replayable cognitive operating system that replaces fragmented vendor stacks with a unified brain:

- Autonomous execution across markets, models, and agents  
- Full replayability via audit DAGs  
- Persona-reinforced reasoning (<em>Athena, Apollo, Nemesis</em>)  
- High-integrity chain-of-thought management  
- LCAC-secured cognitive boundaries  
- Federated scoring + mode-stability analytics  

VANTA OS is built for environments where reasoning quality, stability, and governance are mission-critical.

# Reasoning Integrity Standard (RIS)

**RIS** is the world’s first formal standard for evaluating the *integrity* of LLM reasoning:

- Measures chain stability, drift, semantic coherence, variance envelopes  
- Defines RIS-0 → RIS-4 maturity levels  
- Auditable, reproducible methodology  
- Enterprise-ready scoring framework  
- Regulatory-aligned for finance, healthcare, and real-time decision systems  
- Backed by LCAC as the reference implementation

# LCAC — Least-Context Access Control

**LCAC** is the cognitive-layer security framework that enforces:

- Context boundaries  
- Reasoning drift detection  
- Stability envelopes  
- Persona-driven calibration  
- Deterministic replayability  

This is how we prevent cognitive degradation, injection drift, and multi-agent instability at scale.

LCAC is the reference implementation for RIS-aligned evaluation.
